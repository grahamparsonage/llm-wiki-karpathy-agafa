Core legal and procedural constraints that digital forensic workflows must satisfy to support lawful, proportionate, and admissible evidence handling.

## Definition
Legal constraints in digital forensics are jurisdiction-specific requirements governing acquisition, analysis, disclosure, privacy interference, and courtroom use of digital evidence.

## Key constraints (as framed in source)
- **Lawful authority and scope**: Actions should remain within warrant/authorization boundaries.
- **Proportionality and necessity**: Privacy interference should be limited to investigative need.
- **Evidence integrity**: Avoid altering original data unless strictly necessary and explainable.
- **Reproducibility and auditability**: Maintain records so a third party can review/recreate outcomes.
- **Competence and accreditation context**: Tool/process reliability and calibration evidence matter.
- **Court-facing explainability**: Findings must be understandable and support expert evidence standards.

## Why this matters for AI-enabled DF
AI systems used in DF must provide not only outputs, but also a verifiable reasoning trail and bounded behavior aligned to legal scope.

## In AGAFA
AGAFA addresses constraints by combining ontology-defined boundaries with ASP rule checks over model inferences, then producing reportable, auditable outputs.

## ACPO-aligned constraints (UK-focused)
- **Data integrity:** avoid changing data that may be relied upon in court.
- **Competent access:** original data access should be performed by competent personnel who can explain implications.
- **Auditability:** preserve records so an independent third party can reproduce outcomes.
- **Accountability:** the person in charge is responsible for legal and principle adherence.
- **Proportionality:** scope and seizure decisions should be justified, documented, and proportionate to investigative need.
