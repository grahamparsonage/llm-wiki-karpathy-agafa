# Knowledge Base Overview

*This page is the LLM's working synthesis of everything in the wiki. It updates after every ingest that shifts the big picture.*

---

## Current State

This wiki now includes six ingested sources with framework, procedural, proactive/reactive process, ontology-engineering, rule/ontology integration, and ASP-foundations guidance for explainable digital forensics.

**Source count:** 6
**Wiki pages:** 30 (index, log, overview, glossary, 6 sources, 1 product, 15 concepts, 1 style rule, 3 analyses)
**Last ingest:** 2026-04-17 — The Proactive and Reactive Digital Forensics Investigation Process
**Last lint:** —

## What This Wiki Covers

This knowledge base currently focuses on AI-assisted digital forensics documentation, with emphasis on explainability, formal validation, and UK-focused legal/procedural constraints.

Current coverage includes:
- The AGAFA framework as a product-level reference
- ACPO digital evidence principles as a UK-focused procedural baseline
- Proactive/reactive DF process modeling for live evidence capture and post-incident handoff
- Ontology-engineering patterns for semantic evidence integration and automation
- Rules-and-ontologies integration patterns for explicit derivation workflows
- ASP foundations including stable model semantics and generate-define-test modeling
- Neuro-symbolic architecture patterns for forensic workflows
- RAG/KAG knowledge-grounding approaches
- ASP-based rule validation
- Legal/admissibility-oriented constraints in investigative contexts

## Key Themes

- **Explainability over black-box automation:** AI outputs are paired with explicit knowledge structures and validation logic.
- **Hybrid architecture:** MM-LLM inference is combined with symbolic ontologies and formal rule checks.
- **Auditability and reproducibility:** Workflows prioritize contemporaneous records and third-party reviewability.
- **Procedural governance baseline:** ACPO principles provide UK-focused process guardrails for evidence handling and reporting.
- **Proactive-to-reactive handoff:** Event-triggered live evidence workflows can feed structured post-mortem investigation.
- **Semantic integration focus:** Ontology engineering and Semantic Web standards enable machine-interpretable evidence fusion and reasoning.
- **Reasoning design focus:** Query-language and inference-pattern choices materially affect expressiveness and evaluation behavior.
- **Scope-bounded investigation design:** Investigation behavior is constrained by legal authority and proportionality principles.
- **Sensitive-domain handling discipline:** Sensitive case examples are documented only at high level, with no operational detail.

## Open Questions

- UK-focused framing is now applied. Which non-UK jurisdiction should be prioritized next for comparison/adaptation?
- Should the wiki include a dedicated page for forensic workflow standards (for example, ISO 17025, evidence handling principles) separate from legal constraints?
- Which audience should be prioritized next for documentation outputs: investigators, legal reviewers, or policy/oversight stakeholders?
- Do you want a dedicated analysis comparing ontology stacks (CASE/UCO/DFAX/ParFor/WSFO) for implementation readiness?

## Knowledge Gaps

*(Areas where more sources are needed. The LLM will flag these during ingests and lint passes.)*
