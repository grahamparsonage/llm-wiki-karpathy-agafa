# Glossary

Living reference of terms, definitions, and style conventions. The LLM checks this before using any technical term. Updated on every ingest that introduces new or refined terminology.

## Style Conventions

| Convention | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Acronym introduction | Define on first use, then use acronym consistently. | `Answer Set Programming (ASP)` then `ASP` |
| Framework naming | Treat AGAFA as product/framework in this wiki. | `AGAFA framework` |
| Sensitive scenarios | Keep sensitive case examples high-level and non-operational. | `A sensitive-domain use case is summarized at a high level.` |
| Legal language precision | Use `legal constraints` / `admissibility` precisely; avoid overclaiming legal certainty. | `supports admissibility-focused workflows` |

---

## Deprecated / Avoid List

Terms that have been replaced, renamed, or should not be used:

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Agafa | AGAFA | Canonical capitalization |
| multimode LLM | MM-LLM / multimodal LLM | Consistency with canonical term |
| graph RAG | KAG (or specify exact method) | Avoid ambiguous shorthand |
| court-ready AI | admissibility-focused, auditable workflow | More precise, less promotional |
| automated CSAM detection details | high-level sensitive-domain summary | Safety and scope discipline |

---

## Regional / Variant Terms

Terms that differ between audiences, teams, or locales:

| Term | Region/Context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| digital evidence | UK/US legal + forensic contexts | Preferred neutral term across regions |
| lawful authority / warrant scope | Jurisdiction-specific | Keep wording general unless jurisdiction is explicitly in scope |
| admissibility | Court/procedure context | Meaning varies by jurisdiction; avoid universal claims |
